<h2>Why we love robotics!</h2>
<p>We love robotics because you can costumise the bot how you want, its personality is the code and its body is well....
Also they can come in different shapes and sizes and over the years (well it feels like it) we got atatched to nano shork (our bot) but SOMEONE destroyed it so we honered him by naming our next bot NANO SHORK JR (very origonal)</p>

<h1>Here are some pictures of bots in development</h1>
